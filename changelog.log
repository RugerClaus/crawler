Alpha 0.1.0 ---- LOG

Yet another attempt at making a game. This time I have removed everything but the player. I now have a top down world using the same character from that youtube tutorial that I
seem to not be able to find. Oh well. I liked the assets. I have ditched them all. Now for the first version of this game.

So far you can collect coins. The player now has multidirectional animations. The coins all have an assigned value with gold ones being the highest. I have started integrating 
walls as well. That's huge. The boundaries work pretty well at the moment. I think this will be a maze/puzzle dungeon crawler. I want to have keys to get to further levels. 
There should be some sort of portal and I already have a door graphic to test with lol. It's trash.

You can also move diagonally which is neat. 

This now has lots of pieces from previous setups (see the other two public repos on this profile), but I have now done a different style of level generation. Using a fixed grid.

I will try to expand on this because I have given up on chunking for now. Maybe that will be something I learn later. For now fixed levels are handled in /assets/levels/level1.json
I'll need to make this interchangeable with different levels. So I will probably add that in the next version. I know this is a huge amount of code for a first commit, but
everything works, and is pretty extendable.
